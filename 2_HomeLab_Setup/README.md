## Documents in This Folder

### 1. Home Lab Architecture
- **File:** [Home_Lab_Architecture.md](./Home_Lab_Architecture.md)  
- Provides a high-level view of the lab environment, including topology diagrams, network adapter roles, VM isolation strategy, and recommended configurations for safe testing.

### 2. OSI Model Overview
- **File:** [OSI_Model.md](./OSI_Model.md)  
- Summarizes the seven layers of the OSI model with examples, a comparison table, and an ASCII diagram. Useful for troubleshooting and understanding packet flow.

### 3. Common Network Ports
- **File:** [Common_Network_Ports.md](./Common_Network_Ports.md)  
- A concise reference of well-known ports, protocols, and services frequently encountered during network analysis and SOC workflows.

### 4. Wireshark Display Filters

## Purpose of This Folder

The materials in this directory provide a technical foundation for:

- Configuring an isolated cyber range or testing environment  
- Practicing basic offensive and defensive techniques safely  
- Understanding network behavior at multiple layers  
- Analyzing packets using Wireshark  
- Preparing for SOC, help desk, or entry-level cybersecurity roles  

All files are written to be clear, practical, and suitable for interview preparation or hands-on practice.
