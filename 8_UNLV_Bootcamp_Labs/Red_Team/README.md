# Red Team Labs (UNLV Cybersecurity Bootcamp)

This directory contains selected Red Team–focused labs completed as part of the UNLV Cybersecurity Bootcamp. These labs highlight key offensive security skills including reconnaissance, vulnerability identification, exploitation, and post-exploitation.  

Only the highest-value labs from the bootcamp are included in this section—specifically those that demonstrate practical attacker tradecraft and provide meaningful insight into how adversaries operate in real environments.

## Capabilities Demonstrated

The Red Team labs in this section cover essential offensive techniques used by penetration testers and adversaries:  

### **Reconnaissance & Enumeration**
- Nmap scanning for hosts, ports, services, and versions  
- Identifying attack surfaces and network exposure  

### **Credential Attacks**
- Offline brute-force cracking of hashed passwords  
- Understanding password entropy, hashing, and cracking workflows  

### **Initial Access & Exploitation**
- Establishing reverse shells and executing payloads  
- Using command-line tooling to gain remote access  

### **Web Application Attacks**
- SQL Injection exploitation  
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) payload development  
- Understanding common OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities  

These skills provide the offensive foundation needed to understand real threats, contextualize SOC alerts, and better defend systems.

## Structure of Lab Writeups

Each lab writeup in this folder includes:

1. **Objective**  
2. **Tools Used**  
3. **Execution Process (hands-on actions performed)**  
4. **Payloads / Commands Used**  
5. **Findings & Technical Results**  
6. **Security Impact**  
7. **Mitigation Considerations**  
8. **What I Learned**

This format demonstrates both technical execution and an understanding of defensive implications.

## Purpose of This Folder

The Red Team section strengthens the overall UNLV Bootcamp portfolio by:

- Demonstrating knowledge of attacker workflows  
- Complementing SOC labs with offensive perspective  
- Providing practical exploitation experience  
- Showing the ability to think like an adversary  

This combination of offensive and defensive experience is highly beneficial for SOC Analyst, Cybersecurity Analyst, and Pentester roles.

## Ethical and Legal Notice

All offensive actions documented in this section were performed in controlled, authorized lab environments as part of structured training. No unauthorized systems, networks, or applications were accessed. The purpose of these exercises is strictly educational.
