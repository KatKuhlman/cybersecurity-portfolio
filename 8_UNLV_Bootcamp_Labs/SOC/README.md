# SOC Analysis Labs (UNLV Cybersecurity Bootcamp)

This directory contains selected Security Operations Center (SOC)–focused labs completed as part of the UNLV Cybersecurity Bootcamp. These labs highlight core detection, monitoring, and analysis skills used by SOC analysts in real-world environments.

Only a small number of labs were chosen for this section—specifically those that demonstrate deep, hands-on experience with packet analysis, intrusion detection, and network-based threat investigation.

## Capabilities Demonstrated

These SOC labs showcase practical experience in:

### **Network Forensics & Evidence Extraction**
- Reconstructing transferred files from packet captures  
- Using Wireshark and NetworkMiner to identify malicious artifacts  
- Analyzing traffic patterns for suspicious behavior  

### **Detection Engineering**
- Using Zeek to generate structured logs for network activity  
- Interpreting Zeek logs to identify threats and anomalies  
- Understanding attacker behavior through protocol analysis  

### **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**
- Installing and configuring Suricata on pfSense  
- Applying detection rules and observing network alerts  
- Understanding the relationship between signatures, events, and SOC triage

These skills directly support Tier 1 SOC responsibilities such as investigating alerts, analyzing traffic, validating threats, and escalating incidents.

## Structure of Lab Writeups

Each lab folder contains:

1. **Objective**  
2. **Tools Used**  
3. **Execution Process (hands-on steps performed)**  
4. **Findings / Evidence Collected**  
5. **Threat Impact Analysis**  
6. **Detection Opportunities**  
7. **What I Learned**

This format mirrors how SOC analysts document investigations and supports technical discussion in interviews.

## Purpose of This Folder

The SOC Analysis section serves to:

- Demonstrate applied threat detection skills  
- Highlight the ability to interpret network telemetry  
- Show hands-on experience with widely used open-source tools  
- Tie tactical investigation skills to broader defensive operations  

These labs form the SOC-focused portion of the UNLV Bootcamp portfolio and provide evidence of readiness for Tier 1 SOC roles.
