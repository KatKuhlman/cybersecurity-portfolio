# Blue Team Labs (UNLV Cybersecurity Bootcamp)

This section contains selected Blue Team–focused labs completed as part of the UNLV Cybersecurity Bootcamp. These labs were chosen intentionally for their relevance to real-world defensive security operations, system hardening, and identity and access management.  

Each lab demonstrates practical experience in strengthening Windows environments, applying secure configurations, managing access controls, and enabling meaningful security logging and auditing.

Only the highest-value labs from the bootcamp are included here to ensure a focused, technically strong portfolio.
