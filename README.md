# Cybersecurity Portfolio – Kathleen Kuhlman

I am an entry-level cybersecurity professional focused on security operations, network analysis, and hands-on technical execution. My background includes building and documenting a complete home lab environment, practicing SOC investigation workflows, learning data center fundamentals, and developing structured technical references across multiple domains. This portfolio showcases the practical skills, analysis methods, and foundational knowledge I have built through formal training, self-study, and method-driven experimentation. I am actively developing my capabilities in SOC investigation, networking, system fundamentals, and secure infrastructure as I work toward Security+ and future analyst roles.

## 🔹 How to Navigate This Portfolio

This portfolio is organized by topic so that reviewers can quickly find the type of work they care about most:

- **Certifications and Resume**  
  Start with **[1_Certifications](./1_Certifications)** and **[Resume_and_Links.md](./Resume_and_Links.md)** for formal credentials, transcripts, and my resume.

- **Foundational Knowledge**  
  For core concepts that support everything else, see:  
  - **[3_Networking](./3_Networking)** – IPv4 subnetting, IPsec, and networking fundamentals  
  - **[4_IT_Fundamentals](./4_IT_Fundamentals)** – hardware, operating system, and basic security concepts  

- **Hands-On Lab Work**  
  To review how I design and use my lab environment:  
  - **[2_HomeLab_Setup](./2_HomeLab_Setup)** – lab topology, OSI model, common ports, and Wireshark filters  

- **Applied Security and SOC Practice**  
  For examples of practical analysis and investigation workflows:  
  - **[6_SOC_Practice](./6_SOC_Practice)** – email header analysis and blue-team style workflows  
  - **[7_TryHackMe_Writeups](./7_TryHackMe_Writeups)** – methodology-only lab writeups (no flags or answers)  

- **Infrastructure and Data Center Focus**  
  For physically oriented, infrastructure-focused knowledge:  
  - **[5_DataCenter_Fundamentals](./5_DataCenter_Fundamentals)** – cabling, racks, storage, power, and cooling  
  - **[8_UNLV_Bootcamp_Labs](./8_UNLV_Bootcamp_Labs)** – selected bootcamp labs reformatted into professional documentation  

Each folder contains its own README to explain what is inside and how it relates to entry-level roles such as SOC analyst, data center technician, or junior security analyst.

## 🔹 Recruiter Snapshot

If you’re evaluating me for an entry-level cybersecurity, SOC analyst, or IT infrastructure role, here is a quick overview of what this portfolio demonstrates:
