# Offensive Security Practice

This section contains hands-on offensive security exercises completed outside of the UNLV Cybersecurity Bootcamp curriculum. These labs focus on reconnaissance, enumeration, exploitation, and post-exploitation techniques that strengthen practical red team capabilities.  

The purpose of this folder is to document technical offensive workflows that support SOC analysis, adversarial mindset development, and security investigation skills. These writeups do not duplicate UNLV bootcamp labs; instead, they capture additional offensive practice that complements the main portfolio.

## Contents
Each subfolder in this directory represents a specific offensive technique or scenario. Examples of topics that may appear in this section include:

- Network scanning and reconnaissance  
- Brute-force techniques  
- Exploitation of vulnerable services  
- Payload execution and reverse shells  
- Web application attacks  
- Post-exploitation and privilege escalation  
- Adversarial simulations used to support SOC detection tuning  

Writeups in this section follow a consistent structure:
1. **Objective**  
2. **Tools Used**  
3. **Execution Process**  
4. **Findings / Results**  
5. **Security Impact Analysis**  
6. **Mitigation or Defensive Considerations**  
7. **What I Learned**

## Purpose and Value

Offensive security practice is essential for developing strong defensive capabilities. By performing controlled red team exercises, analysts gain:

- A deeper understanding of attacker behavior  
- Improved ability to identify malicious patterns in logs and network traffic  
- Practical exposure to exploitation workflows  
- Context for tuning alerts, filters, and detection rules  
- Insight into how real-world adversaries operate  

This folder supplements the main portfolio with additional technical depth and demonstrates the ability to think like an attacker while working as a defender.

## Ethical and Legal Notice

All activities documented in this folder were conducted in a safe, controlled, and legally authorized environment. No actions were taken against unauthorized systems, networks, or applications. The purpose of these exercises is strictly educational and defensive in nature.
